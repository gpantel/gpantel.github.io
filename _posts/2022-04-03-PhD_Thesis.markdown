Introduction to L<sub>o</sub> phases, cholesterol induction of L<sub>o</sub> phase and modulating APP-C99, and the role of L<sub>o</sub> phase and subcellular compartments in AÎ² generation.
<br/><br/>

I graduated from Boston University a few months ago. My thesis entitled "Lipid Bilayer Phase Separation, Cholesterol, and Their Effect on the Amyloid Precursor Protein C99" mostly consists of our previously published work.

The lengthy introduction provides a very helpful introduction to the liquid ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) phase transition, the role of cholesterol in inducting the L<sub>o</sub> phase, the role of cholesterol in modulating processing and structure of C99, and the overall potential role of lipid phase separation and protein trafficking in the genesis of Amyloid beta. I've realized it is difficult for theses to pop up in searches, so [I've posted my dissertation here]({{ site.url }}/assets/PDF/Thesis_GAP.pdf) in hopes that others can access this introduction in particular.

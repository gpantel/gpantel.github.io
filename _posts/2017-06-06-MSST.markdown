This is a placeholder for a lengthy post about mass-scaling simulated tempering, supplying a few details on the theory, providing an explanation of the OpenMM implementation, and linking to the github entry for an example with Trpcage folding.

Please read and cite: "On the use of mass scaling for stable and efficient simulated tempering with molecular dynamics," T. Nagai, G.A. Pantelopulos, T. Takahashi, J.E. Straub *J. Comp. Chem.* **27** 2017-2028 (2016).
